## (I) Abstract : 

Misdiagnosis of the many diseases have a colossal impact on agricultural crops which in turn leads to misuse of chemicals leading to the emergence of resistant pathogen strains, increased input costs, and more outbreaks with significant economic loss and environmental impacts.

Current disease diagnosis based on human scouting is time-consuming and expensive. Yesterday, I finally finished my work revolving around deep learning and computer vision to identify category of foliage diseases in apple leaves.

This project was part of Plant Pathology 2020 challenge hosted a while back on kaggle :

## (II) Dataset Used : 

Apple orchards in the U.S. are under constant threat from a large number of pathogens and insects. Appropriate and timely deployment of disease management depends on early disease detection. Incorrect and delayed diagnosis can result in either excessive or inadequate use of chemicals, with increased production costs, environmental, and health impacts. We have manually captured 3,651 high-quality, real-life symptom images of multiple apple foliar diseases, with variable illumination, angles, surfaces, and noise. A subset, expert-annotated to create a pilot dataset for apple scab, cedar apple rust, and healthy leaves, was made available to the Kaggle community for 'Plant Pathology Challenge'; part of the Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) workshop at CVPR 2020 (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition).

The dataset is uploaded on my google drive and can also be accessed on Kaggle. Following are the links :

* G-Drive : *https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IosfDui0TSxy22WQJuN8hYNtQWt5ocXY?usp=sharing* 

The dataset composed of about :
* 1,821 training images. Each image belonged to either of the mentioned catregory : 
  * Healthy
  * Multiple Diseased
  * Rust
  * Scab
* 1,821 testing images take from the same source distribution. Our goal was to classify these images into either of the four aforementioned classes.

# (III) Libraries used :

## Numpy :

Fundamental package for scientific computing in Python3, helping us in creating and managing n-dimensional tensors. A vector can be regarded as a 1-D tensor, matrix as 2-D, and so on.

## Matplotlib :

A Python3 plotting library used for data visualization.

## Tensorflow-Keras :

Is an open source deep learning framework for dataflow and differentiable programming. It’s created and maintained by Google.

## Tqdm :

Is a progress bar library with good support for nested loops and Jupyter notebooks.

## OpenCV : 

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. The library is used extensively in companies, research groups and by governmental bodies.

## Seaborn : 

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) : 

When we’re getting started with a machine learning (ML) project, one critical principle to keep in mind is that data is everything. It is often said that if ML is the rocket engine, then the fuel is the (high-quality) data fed to ML algorithms. However, deriving truth and insight from a pile of data can be a complicated and error-prone job. To have a solid start for our ML project, it always helps to analyze the data up front.

During EDA, it’s important that we get a deep understanding of:

* The **properties of the data**, such as schema and statistical properties;
* The **quality of the data**, like missing values and inconsistent data types;
* The **predictive power of the data**, such as correlation of features against target.

Firstly, the number of various examples belonging to each class were identified and plotted.

Secondly, the color channel distributions were analyzed for the images from the dataset and plotted using seaborn :

**Inference drawn** : 

* Red channel has positive skew, meaning the values are more concentrated at intensities lower than mean(somewhere around 90).
* Green channel is negative skew, meaning the values are more concentrated at intentities higher than mean(somewhere in the range 130-150). This also means that green channel is more pronounced than red in the sample image set; and thereby the whole data set as they come from the same distribution. This makes sense as images are that of leaves!
Similarily, blue channel has a slight positive skew and is very well distributed.
* The distribution of red and green color channels appears to be mesokurtic, aka normally distributed having k = 0 whereas the blue one appears to be relatively platykurtic having k < 0. Therefore out of the three colors, blue channel appears to be the most different one(relative outlier in the RGB color space).

Post this, a sample image is randomly taken on which we will test fire the coming functions in the **Image Processing** segment.
